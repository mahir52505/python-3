1️⃣ Lists
You can create a Series from a Python list.

import pandas as pd

data = [10, 20, 30, 40]
series = pd.Series(data)
print(series)


2️⃣ NumPy Arrays
A Series can be created from a NumPy array.

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
series = pd.Series(arr)
print(series)


3️⃣ Dictionaries
A Series can be created from a dictionary, where keys become the index.


data = {"a": 100, "b": 200, "c": 300}
series = pd.Series(data)
print(series)


4️⃣ Scalar Values (Single Value Repeated)
You can create a Series with a single repeated value.

series = pd.Series(5, index=[0, 1, 2, 3])
print(series)


5️⃣ Tuples
A tuple can also be used to create a Series.

data = (10, 20, 30, 40)
series = pd.Series(data)
print(series)


6️⃣ Pandas Series (Another Series as Input)
You can create a new Series from an existing pandas Series.

old_series = pd.Series([5, 10, 15])
new_series = pd.Series(old_series)
print(new_series)
